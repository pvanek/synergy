<h3>Starting synergy automatically</h3>
<p>
You can configure synergy to start automatically when the computer
starts or when you log in.  The steps to do that are different on
each platform.  Note that changing these configurations doesn't
actually start or stop synergy.  The changes take effect the next
time you start your computer or log in.
</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>
Start synergy and click the <span class="code">Configure...</span> button
by the text <span class="code">Automatic Startup</span>.  The
<span class="code">Auto Start</span> dialog will pop up.
If an error occurs then correct the problem and click
<span class="code">Configure</span> again.
</p>
<p>
On the <span class="code">Auto Start</span> dialog you'll configure
synergy to start or not start automatically when the computer starts
or when you log in.  You need Administrator access rights to start
synergy automatically when the computer starts.  The dialog will let
you know if you have sufficient permission.
</p>
<p>
If synergy is already configured to automatically start then there
will be two <span class="code">Uninstall</span> buttons, at most one
of which is enabled.  Click the enabled button, if any, to tell
synergy to not start automatically.
</p>
<p>
If synergy is not configured to start automatically then there will
be two <span class="code">Install</span> buttons.  If you have
sufficient permission to have synergy start automatically when the
computer does then the <span class="code">Install</span> button in the
<span class="code">When Computer Starts</span> box will be enabled.
Click it to have synergy start for all users when the computer starts.
In this case, synergy will be available during the login screen.
Otherwise, click the <span class="code">Install</span> button in the
<span class="code">When You Log In</span> box to have synergy
automatically start when you log in.
</p>

<h4>Unix</h4>
<p>
Synergy requires an X server.  That means a server must be
running and synergy must be authorized to connect to that server.
It's best to have the display manager start synergy.  You'll need
the necessary (probably root) permission to modify the display
manager configuration files.  If you don't have that permission
you can start synergy after logging in via the
<span class="code">.xsession</span> file.
</p>
<p>
Typically, you need to edit three script files.  The first file
will start synergy before a user logs in, the second will kill
that copy of synergy, and the third will start it again after
the user logs in.
</p>
<p>
The contents of the scripts varies greatly between systems so
there's no one definite place where you should insert your edits.
However, these scripts often exit before reaching the bottom so
put the edits near the top of the script.
</p>
<p>
The location and names of these files depend on the operating
system and display manager you're using.  A good guess for the
location is <span class="code">/etc/X11</span>.  Typical file names
are:
</p>
<p class="code">
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td>xdm</td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td>gdm</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td> <td></td> <td>xdm/Xsetup</td>   <td></td> <td>gdm/Init/Default (*)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td> <td></td> <td>xdm/Xstartup</td> <td></td> <td>gdm/PostLogin/Default (*)</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td> <td></td> <td>xdm/Xsession</td> <td></td> <td>gdm/Sessions/Default (*, **)</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
*) The <span class="code">Default</span> file is used if no other
suitable file is found.  <span class="code">gdm</span> will try
<span class="arg">displayname</span> (e.g. <span class="code">:0</span>)
and <span class="arg">hostname</span> (e.g. <span class="code">somehost</span>),
in that order, before and instead of <span class="code">Default</span>.
<br>
**) gdm may use <span class="code">gdm/Xsession</span>,
<span class="code">xdm/Xsession</span> or
<span class="code">dm/Xsession</span> if
<span class="code">gdm/Sessions/Default</span> doesn't exist.
</p>
<p>
For a synergy client, add the following to the first file:
<pre>
  /usr/bin/killall synergyc
  sleep 1
  /usr/bin/synergyc [&lt;options&gt;] <span class="arg">synergy-server-hostname</span>
</pre>
Of course, the path to synergyc depends on where you installed it
so adjust as necessary.
</p>
<p>
Add to the second file:
<pre>
  /usr/bin/killall synergyc
  sleep 1
</pre>
</p>
<p>
And to the third file:
<pre>
  /usr/bin/killall synergyc
  sleep 1
  /usr/bin/synergyc <span class="arg">[&lt;options&gt;]</span> <span class="arg">synergy-server-hostname</span>
</pre>
Note that <a href="running.html#options"><span class="arg">&lt;options&gt;</span></a>
must not include
<span class="code">-f</span> or <span class="code">--no-daemon</span> or
the script will never exit and you won't be able to log in.
</p>
<p>
The changes are the same for the synergy server except replace
<span class="code">synergyc</span> with <span class="code">synergys</span>
and use the appropriate synergys <a href="running.html#options">command
line options</a>.  Note that the
first script is run as root so synergys will look for the configuration
file in root's home directory then in <span class="code">/etc</span>.
Make sure it exists in one of those places or use the
<span class="code">--config <span class="arg">config-pathname</span></span>
option to specify its location.
</p>
<p>
Note that some display managers (xdm and kdm, but not gdm) grab
the keyboard and do not release it until the user logs in for
security reasons.  This prevents a synergy server from sharing
the mouse and keyboard until the user logs in.  It doesn't
prevent a synergy client from synthesizing mouse and keyboard
input, though.
</p>
<p>
If you're configuring synergy to start only after you log in then edit
your <span class="code">.xsession</span> file.  Add just what you
would add to the third file above.
