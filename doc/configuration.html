<h3>Synergy Configuration File Format</h3>
<p>
The synergy server requires configuration.  It will try certain
pathnames to load the configuration file if you don't specify a
path using the <span class="code">--config</span> command line
option.  <span class="code">synergys --help</span> reports those
pathnames.
</p>
<p>
The configuration file is a plain text file.  Use any text editor
to create the configuration file.  The file is broken into sections
and each section has the form:
<pre>
  section: <span class="arg">name</span>
    <span class="arg">args</span>
  end
</pre>
Comments are introduced by <span class="code">#</span> and continue to
the end of the line.  <span class="arg">name</span> must be one of the
following:
<ul class="code">
<li>screens
<li>aliases
<li>links
<li>options
</ul>
See below for further explanation of each section type.  The
configuration file is case-sensitive so <span class="code">Section</span>,
<span class="code">SECTION</span>, and <span class="code">section</span>
are all different and only the last is valid.  Screen names are the
exception;  screen names are case-insensitive.
</p>
<p>
The file is parsed top to bottom and names cannot be used before
they've been defined in the <span class="code">screens</span> or
<span class="code">aliases</span> sections.  So the
<span class="code">links</span> and <span class="code">aliases</span>
must appear after the <span class="code">screens</span> and links
cannot refer to aliases unless the <span class="code">aliases</span>
appear before the <span class="code">links</span>.
</p>
<h4>screens</h4>
<p>
<span class="arg">args</span> is a list of screen names, one name per
line, each followed by a colon.  Names are arbitrary strings but they
must be unique.  The hostname of each computer is recommended.  (This
is the computer's network name on win32 and the name reported by the
program <span class="code">hostname</span> on Unix and OS X.  Note
that OS X may append <span class="code">.local</span> to the name you
gave your computer; e.g. <span class="code">somehost.local</span>.)
There must be a screen name for the server and each client.  Each
screen can specify a number of options.  Options have the form
<span class="code"><span class="arg">name</span> =
<span class="arg">value</span></span> and are listed one per line
after the screen name.
</p>
<p>
Example:
<pre>
    section: screens
    	moe:
    	larry:
            halfDuplexCapsLock = true
            halfDuplexNumLock = true
    	curly:
            meta = alt
    end
</pre>
This declares three screens named <span class="code">moe</span>,
<span class="code">larry</span>, and <span class="code">curly</span>.
Screen <span class="code">larry</span> has half-duplex Caps Lock and
Num Lock keys (see below) and screen <span class="code">curly</span>
converts the meta modifier key to the alt modifier key.
</p>
<p>
A screen can have the following options:
<ul>
<li><span class="code">halfDuplexCapsLock = {true|false}</span>
<p>
        This computer has a Caps Lock key that doesn't report a
        press and a release event when the user presses it but
        instead reports a press event when it's turned on and a
        release event when it's turned off.  If Caps Lock acts
        strangely on all screens then you may need to set this
        option to <span class="code">true</span>
        on the server screen.  If it acts strangely on one
        screen then that screen may need the option set to
        <span class="code">true</span>.
</p>
<li><span class="code">halfDuplexNumLock = {true|false}</span>
<p>
        This is identical to <span class="code">halfDuplexCapsLock</span>
        except it applies to the Num Lock key.
</p>
<li><span class="code">halfDuplexScrollLock = {true|false}</span>
<p>
        This is identical to <span class="code">halfDuplexCapsLock</span>
        except it applies to the Scroll Lock key.  Note that synergy uses
	Scroll Lock to keep the cursor on the current screen.  That is,
	when Scroll Lock is toggled on, the cursor is locked to the screen
	that it's currently on.  Use it to prevent accidental switching.
</p>
<li><span class="code">switchCorners = &lt;corners&gt;</span>
<p>
	See <a href="#corners">switchCorners</a> below.
</p>
<li><span class="code">switchCornerSize = N</span>
<p>
	See <a href="#cornerSize">switchCornerSize</a> below.
</p>
<li><span class="code">xtestIsXineramaUnaware = {true|false}</span>
<p>
        This option works around a bug in the XTest extension
        when used in combination with Xinerama.  It affects
        X11 clients only.  Not all versions of the XTest
        extension are aware of the Xinerama extension.  As a
        result, they do not move the mouse correctly when
        using multiple Xinerama screens.  This option is
        currently <span class="code">true</span> by default.  If
        you know your XTest extension is Xinerama aware then set
        this option to <span class="code">false</span>.
</p>
<li><span class="code">shift = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}<br>
      ctrl  = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}<br>
      alt   = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}<br>
      meta  = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}<br>
      super = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}</span>
<p>
        Map a modifier key pressed on the server's keyboard to
        a different modifier on this client.  This option only
        has an effect on a client screen;  it's accepted and
        ignored on the server screen.
</p>
<p>
        You can map, say, the shift key to shift (the default),
	    ctrl, alt, meta, super or nothing.  Normally, you
        wouldn't remap shift or ctrl.  You might, however, have
        an X11 server with meta bound to the Alt keys.  To use
        this server effectively with a windows client, which
        doesn't use meta but uses alt extensively, you'll want
        the windows client to map meta to alt (using
        <span class="code">meta = alt</span>).
</p>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>aliases</h4>
<p>
    <span class="arg">args</span> is a list of screen names just like
    in the <span class="code">screens</span> section except each screen
    is followed by a list of aliases, one per line, <b>not</b> followed
    by a colon.  An alias is a screen name and must be unique.  During
    screen name lookup each alias is equivalent to the screen name it
    aliases.  So a client can connect using its canonical screen name
    or any of its aliases.  
</p>
<p>
    Example:
<pre>
    section: aliases
        larry:
            larry.stooges.com
        curly:
            shemp
    end
</pre>
    Screen <span class="code">larry</span> is also known as
	<span class="code">larry.stooges.com</span> and can connect as
    either name.  Screen <span class="code">curly</span> is also
    known as <span class="code">shemp</span> (hey, it's just an example).
</p>

<h4>links</h4>
<p>
    <span class="arg">args</span> is a list of screen names just like
    in the <span class="code">screens</span> section except each screen
    is followed by a list of links, one per line.  Each link has the
    form <span class="code">{left|right|up|down}</span> =
    <span class="code">name</span>.  A link indicates which screen is
    adjacent in the given direction.
</p>
<p> 
    Example:
<pre>
    section: links
        moe:
            right = larry
            up    = curly
        larry:
            left  = moe
            up    = curly
        curly:
            down  = larry
    end
</pre>
    This indicates that screen <span class="code">larry</span> is to
    the right of screen <span class="code">moe</span> (so moving the
    cursor off the right edge of <span class="code">moe</span> would
    make it appear at the left edge of <span class="code">larry</span>),
    <span class="code">curly</span> is above <span class="code">moe</span>,
    <span class="code">moe</span> is to the left of
    <span class="code">larry</span>, <span class="code">curly</span> is
    above <span class="code">larry</span>, and
    <span class="code">larry</span> is below
    <span class="code">curly</span>.  Note that links do not have to be
    symmetrical;  moving up from <span class="code">moe</span> then down
    from <span class="code">curly</span> lands the cursor on
    <span class="code">larry</span>.
</p>

<h4>options</h4>
<p>
    <span class="arg">args</span> is a list of lines of the form
    <span class="code">name = value</span>.  These set the global
    options.
</p>
<p>
    Example:
<pre>
    section: options
        heartbeat = 5000
        switchDelay = 500
    end
</pre>
</p>
<p>
    You can use the following options:
<ul>
<li><span class="code">heartbeat = N</span>
<p>
        The server will expect each client to send a message no
        less than every <span class="code">N</span> milliseconds.
        If no message arrives from a client within
        <span class="code">3N</span> seconds the server forces that
        client to disconnect.
</p>
<p>
        If synergy fails to detect clients disconnecting while
        the server is sleeping or vice versa, try using this
        option.
</p>
<li><span class="code"><a name="corners"></a>switchCorners = &lt;corners&gt;</span>
<p>
	Synergy won't switch screens when the mouse reaches the edge of
	the screen if it's in a listed corner.  The size of all corners
	is given by the <span class="code">switchCornerSize</span>
	option.
</p>
<p>
	Corners are specified by a list using the following names:
	<ul>
	<li><span class="code">none</span> -- no corners
	<li><span class="code">top-left</span> -- the top left corner
	<li><span class="code">top-right</span> -- the top right corner
	<li><span class="code">bottom-left</span> -- the bottom left corner
	<li><span class="code">bottom-right</span> -- the bottom right corner
	<li><span class="code">left</span> -- top and bottom left corners
	<li><span class="code">right</span> -- top and bottom right corners
	<li><span class="code">top</span> -- left and right top corners
	<li><span class="code">bottom</span> -- left and right bottom corners
	<li><span class="code">all</span> -- all corners
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The first name in the list is one of the above names and defines
	the initial set of corners.  Subsequent names are prefixed with
	+ or - to add the corner to or remove the corner from the set,
	respectively.  For example:
	<pre>
		all -left +top-left
	</pre>
	starts will all corners, removes the left corners (top and bottom)
	then adds the top-left back in, resulting in the top-left,
	bottom-left and bottom-right corners.
</p>
<li><span class="code"><a name="cornerSize"></a>switchCornerSize = N</span>
<p>
	Sets the size of all corners in pixels.  The cursor must be within
	<span class="code">N</span> pixels of the corner to be considered
	to be in the corner.
</p>
<li><span class="code">switchDelay = N</span>
<p>
        Synergy won't switch screens when the mouse reaches the
        edge of a screen unless it stays on the edge for
        <span class="code">N</span>
        milliseconds.  This helps prevent unintentional
        switching when working near the edge of a screen.
</p>
<li><span class="code">switchDoubleTap = N</span>
<p>
        Synergy won't switch screens when the mouse reaches the
        edge of a screen unless it's moved away from the edge
        and then back to the edge within <span class="code">N</span>
        milliseconds.  With
        the option you have to quickly tap the edge twice to
        switch.  This helps prevent unintentional switching
        when working near the edge of a screen.
</p>
<li><span class="code">screenSaverSync = {true|false}</span>
<p>
		If set to <span class="code">false</span> then synergy
		won't synchronize screen savers.  Client screen savers
		will start according to their individual configurations. 
		The server screen saver won't start if there is input,
		even if that input is directed toward a client screen.
</p>
<li><span class="code">relativeMouseMoves = {true|false}</span>
<p>
		If set to <span class="code">true</span> then secondary
		screens move the mouse using relative rather than
		absolute mouse moves when and only when Scroll Lock is
		toggled on (i.e. the cursor is locked to the screen). 
		This is intended to make synergy work better with certain
		games.  If set to <span class="code">false</span> or not
		set then all mouse moves are absolute.
</p>
</ul>
    You can use both the <span class="code">switchDelay</span> and
    <span class="code">switchDoubleTap</span> options at the same
    time.  Synergy will switch when either requirement is satisfied.
