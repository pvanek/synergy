Synergy To Do List
==================

Things to do to synergy, in no particular order:

* Provide GUI configuration

  There's a GUI tool on win32 but no other platforms.  Also, it'd be
  nice if the tool allowed users to drag screen icons around to set
  the links between them (though this assumes links are symmetrical
  and synergy supports asymmetrical links).

* Provide taskbar feedback

  There's a tray icon on win32 for checking synergy's current status
  and to quit synergy.  It'd be nice to have something similar on
  X11.

* Port to other platforms

  Most desired is MacOS X.

* Write man/html pages

* Provide a win32 installer/uninstaller

  Synergy doesn't have any special needs so even just unzipping is
  satisfactory, but a proper installer would be nice.  And, more
  importantly, it should provide an uninstaller.

* Add more clipboard formats

  Synergy currently supports only text on the clipboard.  It should
  support more formats, such as images and sound.  For each format,
  some canonical type must be chosen.  For text, that's UTF-8 with
  \n for newlines.  For images, it might be BMP or PNG.  Whatever it
  is it should losslessly support any type it might be converted to.
  The type is converted to each platform's native type.  For example,
  BMP for images on win32.

Then there are major new features:

* Provide a KVM mode

  In this mode synergy would share the monitor in addition to the
  keyboard and mouse.

* Support for limited drag and drop between systems

* Support for (virtual) terminals on unix

  This would be useful in KVM mode to administer several remote
  headless systems that you don't want running X just so synergy
  can work.

* Configurable keys

  This includes shortcuts to jump to different screens, always
  directing certain keystrokes to the same system, never sending
  certain keystrokes to some systems, and remapping keys on the
  server to other keys on the clients.
